2018-04-18 09:33:09 : Testing CalculateRoadPerformance. 

2018-04-18 09:33:09 : Attempting to load datastore. 

2018-04-18 09:33:09 : Datastore loaded. 

2018-04-18 09:33:09 : Attempting to load and check specifications. 

2018-04-18 09:33:09 : Module specifications successfully loaded and checked for errors. 

2018-04-18 09:33:09 : Warning note to module developer. The Get specification for dataset FwyNoneCongChg in table Marea does not specify a currency year. The model user's base year will be assumed when the module is called. If this is not the intended behavior, include the intended currency year in the UNITS specification as described in the VisionEval module developer documentation. 

2018-04-18 09:33:09 : Warning note to module developer. The Get specification for dataset FwyModCongChg in table Marea does not specify a currency year. The model user's base year will be assumed when the module is called. If this is not the intended behavior, include the intended currency year in the UNITS specification as described in the VisionEval module developer documentation. 

2018-04-18 09:33:09 : Warning note to module developer. The Get specification for dataset FwyHvyCongChg in table Marea does not specify a currency year. The model user's base year will be assumed when the module is called. If this is not the intended behavior, include the intended currency year in the UNITS specification as described in the VisionEval module developer documentation. 

2018-04-18 09:33:09 : Warning note to module developer. The Get specification for dataset FwySevCongChg in table Marea does not specify a currency year. The model user's base year will be assumed when the module is called. If this is not the intended behavior, include the intended currency year in the UNITS specification as described in the VisionEval module developer documentation. 

2018-04-18 09:33:09 : Warning note to module developer. The Get specification for dataset FwyExtCongChg in table Marea does not specify a currency year. The model user's base year will be assumed when the module is called. If this is not the intended behavior, include the intended currency year in the UNITS specification as described in the VisionEval module developer documentation. 

2018-04-18 09:33:09 : Warning note to module developer. The Get specification for dataset ArtNoneCongChg in table Marea does not specify a currency year.
