# VERSPM #  
VERSPM is the implementation of the Regional Strategic Planning Model (RSPM) in the VisionEval model system. The model run files are organized into two directories to reflect how the RSPM model has been used in strategic assessments in which hundreds of model runs are carried out to explore the decision space. Typically several land use scenarios are developed and then a number of transportation scenarios are run for each land use scenarios. Land use scenarios include the assumptions about household demographics, economics, and land use attributes. The **LandUse** directory contains the files for creating a land use scenario. The model run script calls modules that create simulated households and a variety of land use characteristics. In the future, a **Transport** scenario directory will be added to run transportation-related modules.
