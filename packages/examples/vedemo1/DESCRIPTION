Description: This package demonstrates the structure of VisionEval modules
    and how modules are combined in a package. Modules are one of the elements
    of the VisionEval model system which is a system for developing strategic
    planning models that simulate household behavior. VisionEval models are
    implemented as R scripts that invoke modules in succession. A second
    element is a set of standards for the definition of key model elements such
    as geography and the structure and organization of model files. The third
    element is the software framework that runs modules, manages model data,
    and coordinates model execution.
